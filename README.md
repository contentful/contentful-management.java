Java SDK for [Contentful's][1] Content Management API.

[Contentful][1] provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.

Setup
=====

Grab via Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.contentful.java</groupId>
  <artifactId>cma-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
or Gradle:
```groovy
compile 'com.contentful.java:cma-sdk:3.0.0'
```

The SDK requires at minimum Java 6 or Android 2.3.

#### Snapshots

Snapshots of the development version are available through [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap]

```groovy
maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }
compile 'com.contentful.java:cma-sdk:3.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
```

and through [jitpack.io][jitpack]:

```groovy
maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
compile 'com.github.contentful:contentful.java:cma-sdk-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
```

### Default Client

The SDK uses [Retrofit][2] under the hood as a REST client, which detects [OkHttp][3] in your classpath and uses it if it's available, otherwise falls back to the default `HttpURLConnection`.

The recommended approach would be to add [OkHttp][3] as a dependency to your project, but that is completely optional.

You can also specify a custom client to be used, refer to the [official documentation][4] for instructions.

### ProGuard

```
-keepattributes Signature
-dontwarn rx.**
-dontwarn retrofit.**
-keep class retrofit.** { *; }
-keep class com.contentful.java.cma.** { *; }
-keep class com.google.gson.** { *; }
-keep class sun.misc.Unsafe { *; }
```

Usage
=====

### Client

In the beginning the API client instance should be created:

```java
final CMAClient client =
    new CMAClient
        .Builder()
        .setAccessToken("<access_token>")
        .build();
```

The access token can easily be obtained through the [management API documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/authentication/#getting-a-personal-access-token).

A client can perform various operations on different types of resources (Assets, Content Types, Entries, Spaces, etc). Every type of resource is represented by a module in the `CMAClient` class, for example:

```java
client.spaces() // returns the Spaces module
client.entries() // returns the Entries module
client.assets() // returns the Assets module
â€¦
```

Each module contains a set of methods which can be used to perform various operations on the specified resource type. Every method has a corresponding asynchronous extension which can be accessed through the `async()` method of the module, for example:

#### Retrieving all spaces (synchronously):

```java
final CMAArray<CMASpace> array =
    client
        .spaces()
        .fetchAll();
```

#### or asynchronously:

```java
final CMAArray<CMASpace> array =
    client
        .spaces()
        .async()
        .fetchAll(new CMACallback<CMAArray<CMASpace>>() {
  @Override protected void onSuccess(CMAArray<CMASpace> result) {
    // success
  }

  @Override protected void onFailure(RetrofitError retrofitError) {
    // failure
  }
});
```

Please note that the default `CMACallback` has an empty `onFailure()` implementation, which makes it optional to override it.

If you want to see the SDK in action, please check with [our CMA documentation][docs], which offers snippets for all the relevant and supported parts, just select an endpoint and select the language java.

### Client Configuration

Instead of repeating the space and environment id with every call like so

```java
final CMAArray<CMAEntry> array =
    client
        .entries()
        .fetchAll(
            "space_id",
            "environment_id",
        );
```

you can configure the client to use some default values for space and environment like so

```java
final CMAClient client =
    new CMAClient
        .Builder()
        .setAccessToken("<access_token>")
        .setSpaceId("<space_id>")
        .setEnvironmentId("<environment_id>")
        .build();
```

This way your calls to the entries would look like this

```java
final CMAArray<CMAEntry> array =
    client
        .entries()
        .fetchAll();
```

#### Words of warning

Currently `apiKeys`, `environments`, `roles`, `spaceMemberships`, `uiExtensions`, `uploads`, and
`webhooks`, do not support environments different to `master` (or Constants.DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT). If
you want to use the configuration explained above with theses endpoints, be aware that they will
throw an exception symbolising that you cannot use them with a defined environment id. Please create
a new client without specifying an environment id to perform an action like this.
